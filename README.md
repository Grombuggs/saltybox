## Chaotic and "balanced" supplement to Magic: The Gathering.

### What is Saltybox?
Saltybox is a modular fan-made supplement to Magic: The Gathering, where you'll be able to use existing cards from other trading card games. Inspired by [PleasantKenobi](https://link.space/@PleasantKenobi)'s **Partybox**, Saltybox aims to create a slightly more balanced, but still chaotic and fun experience.

### What cards are supported?
Currently, Saltybox supports cards from the following games:
- Pok√©mon
- Yu-Gi-Oh!
- Duel Masters
- Doomtrooper
- Gormiti
- Chaotic
- Weird n' Wild Creatures
- .HACK//Enemy
- C-23
- Hercules: The Legendary Journeys CCG
- Playing Cards (standard 52-card deck)
- Numberless or hard to define cards (e.g. Baseball cards)
- Magic: The Gathering (duh!)
