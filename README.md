## Chaotic and "balanced" supplement to Magic: The Gathering.

### What is Saltybox?
Saltybox is a modular fan-made supplement to Magic: The Gathering, where you'll be able tu use existing cards from other trading card games. Inspired by PleasantKenobi's **Partybox**, Saltybox aims to create a slightly more balanced, but still chaotic and fun experience.
